This project is made as part of the Odin Project React Series . The user wins by clicking in each card displayed only once, the more cards clicked the higher the score!

# Notes

This project makes use of <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeApi</a> along with a custom hook to fetch a random chain of pokemon every time the round is updated. Using the fetched data we are able to update the UI based on different information regarding each pokemon.The shuffle Function updates the display every time a card is clicked.
